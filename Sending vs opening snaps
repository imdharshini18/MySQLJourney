with cte as (SELECT age_bucket,
   sum(CASE WHEN activity_type='open' then time_spent else 0 end) as sumopen,
   sum(CASE WHEN activity_type='send' then time_spent else 0 end) as sumsend
FROM activities a inner join age_breakdown ag on a.user_id=ag.user_id group by age_bucket)

SELECT 
  age_bucket, 
  ROUND(100.00*sumsend/(sumsend+sumopen),2) AS send_perc, 
  ROUND(100.00*sumopen/(sumsend+sumopen),2) AS open_perc FROM cte;
